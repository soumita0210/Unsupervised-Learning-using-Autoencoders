# Unsupervised-Learning-using-Autoencoders
Unsupervised Learning refers to the problem in Machine Learning when class labels of instances are not provided. In these types of problems the instances are clustered based on their feature similarities. In this work we have used K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model ( GMM ) for clustering the MNIST Fashion Dataset. To address the problem of the large number of features we used Autoencoders for dimension reduction. Autoencoders are used to compress the images in the dataset, however it results in a lossy compression. However, the reduced dimesions of the images results in K-Means and GMM running more efficiently. Results have been compared for all the experiments using the above three concepts.
